Regardless of what job I may have had in the past, whether it be music education, recruiting, or sales, understanding that I am existing withinleading a team allows me to clearly understand the task at hand.

Purchasing, sales, customer service as well as quotations all fall under the job description of an inside sales representative at DAR since it is a small family owned business. Strictly defined roles are not a part of this job. Various situations required different people to take on various responsibilities which is where communication between all stages of an order is pivotal to success. The quotation process would be the most technical aspect of my time at D.A.R. Calculating yields on material needed, required amount of labor what type of labor as well as the appropriate mark-up for any given product required constant communication between myself and the employees working the fabrication shop. My greatest feeling of satisfaction came from quoting something never done by the company before and having that turn into an actual order. Acquired new business for a longtime customer through competitive quotes and quick lead times for orders. A close attention to inventory management resulted in quick lead times by making sure stock was available for custom items that customer started to purchase.

Skills Used Business, design  sales skills This retail store was a newest branch of an old, well established, family owned chain of stores from the east side of the state. The family had recently hired a new, young general manager. He was responsible, apparently, for some poor management decisions, resulting in the parent company going into bankruptcy and all stores being shut down. 061991 to 091994 OwnerManager Company Name  City , State Converted 7500 square feet of commercial space into 24 individual offices of varying sizes, several cubicle spaces, large and small conference rooms, reception area, secretarial work area and lounge.

Other business services included hosting meetings or conferences and publishing marketing materials for tenants and outside clients. Building was sold in 1993 and new owner had other plans for the space and refused to renew the lease. I had moved the business once and paid for build-out of this space. I couldnt afford to move again decided to close business instead. Current Principal Company Name  City , State Consulted with clients to determine architectural preference to meet overall design goals. Originated and developed creative design concepts.

When business was slow due to recession, etc. I accepted employment with well established firms. I have continued to serve many repeat clients and referrals over the years. Transitional Vocation In 1981, before the advent and common use of CAD programs, I had a serious injury to my right drawing hand. I was owner of income properties and had been managing income propertiesfor other individual owners. Since I was not going to be able to use my hand again for drawing for some time, I took a position as a manager of a 160 unit apartment project that was only 50 occupied. Within six months, all units were rehabbed, rentable and occupied, and 95-100 occupancy was maintained while I was manager. In 1983, I was offered a position with another firm as Project Manager during construction and Start-Up Manager of a 360 unit apartment complex. Being involved at the inception, I was able to revise apartment floor plans to made accommodation for the most common objections I heard while marketing existing floor plans. My revised plans were very successful and apartments were filled as fast as they were built, with a long waiting list. Approximately 13 of the tenants from the first project I had managed, moved to the new complex, which was extremely gratifying. I continued in this position to the end of construction. During that time, I attended property management courses and earned a Residential Property Management Certificate. My hand was rehabilitated by this time and I decided it was time to return to my real passion, interior design.
